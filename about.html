            <h2>What is a Medium Speed Vehicle (PTV)?</h2>
            <p>
                A Medium Speed Vehicle (PTV) is a federally approved class of four-wheeled vehicles that have a maximum speed of 20-25 mph and a gross vehicle weight rating of less than 3,000 pounds. PTVs are street legal on roads with posted speed limits of 35 mph or less in most states, making them perfect for neighborhood transportation, planned communities, college campuses, and small towns.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike traditional golf carts, PTVs are equipped with required safety features including headlights, turn signals, mirrors, windshield, seat belts, and more. These vehicles provide convenient transportation with lower operating costs than traditional vehicles.
            </p>
